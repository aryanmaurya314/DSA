What is backtracking ?
--> Backtracking is a type of recursion in which we are exploring
    all possible ways and undoing them if they lead to a dead end.
    It is commonly used in situations where you need to explore 
    multiple possibilities to solve a problem, like searching for a path in a maze 
    or solving puzzles like Sudoku. When a dead end is reached, the algorithm backtracks 
    to the previous decision point and explores a different path until a solution is found 
    or all possibilities have been exhausted.
