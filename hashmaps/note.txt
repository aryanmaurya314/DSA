Type of maps:
    1. unordered map: Implemented using balanced BST 
        TC{search, insert, delete} = O(logn)
    2. ordered map: Implemented using array, hashtable, bucket array
        TC{search, insert, delete} = O(1)

Hash function: a function used to create key into valid index
    consists of:
        Hash code: formula to convert into integer
        Compression function: change interger to in bounds
        
collision handling: when hash code gives same output 
    techniques:
        1. open hashing: create a linkedlist at collision index
        2. closed addressing: find open index using linear probing or quadratic probing

Note: A good is that which has less number of collisions
